# NOTE: THIS IS A LOAD-BEARING DIRECTORY

crates.io won't let me push my giant fixture PNGs, so I have to lazily load them
in build.rs (or pull them from an environment variable in the case of nix).

Github won't just serve files out of a git repository, so this page is made
public through github pages so that the build.rs script can pull from it.

So now egm96/build.rs references this directory.
