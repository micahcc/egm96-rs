# EGM96

### Introduction

This code is meant to correct the 'default' altitude measurements given by GPS
systems, that measures altitude against the reference ellipsoid and needs to be
corrected to match the actual geoid.

For a any given point whose latitude and longitude is specified, it will output
an altitude offset.

### How to use

The library is meant to be easy to use, and especially easy to embed into your
own softwares.

For rust, just do the normal cargo thing:

```
cargo add egm96
```

For C and C++ build with:

```
cargo build --release
cp target/release/libEGM96.a target/release/libEGM96.so egm96-c/src/egm96.h /path/to/install
```

## About

### About this implementation

This implementation is a fork of [this C
library](https://github.com/emericg/EGM96) which was a
fork of [a project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/egm96-f477-c) by D.Ineiev,
which is translation from Fortran to C of another
[EGM96 implementation](https://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm96/egm96.html)
from the [National Geospacial-intelligence Agency](https://earth-info.nga.mil/).

The code has been converted to rust and exposed as a C API.

### About the original implementation

The program is designed to use the potential coefficient model EGM96 and a set of spherical harmonic coefficients of a correction term.
The correction term is composed of several different components. The primary one being the conversion of a height anomaly to a geoid undulation.
The principles of this procedure were initially described in the paper:

- Use of potential coefficient models for geoid undulation determination using a spherical harmonic representation of the height anomaly/geoid undulation difference by R.H. Rapp, Journal of Geodesy, 1996.

This program is designed to be used with the constants of EGM96 and those of the WGS84 (g873) system. The undulation will refer to the WGS84 ellipsoid.

Specific details on the undulation computation will be found in the joint project report describing the development of EGM96.
This program is a modification of the program described in the following report:

- A fortran program for the computation of gravimetric quantities from high degree spherical harmonic expansions, Richard H. Rapp, report 334, Department of Geodetic Science and Surveying, the Ohio State University, Columbus, 1982.

### About the science

The [World Geodetic System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System) (WGS) is a standard for use in cartography, geodesy, and satellite navigation including GPS. This standard includes the definition of the coordinate system's fundamental and derived constants, the ellipsoidal (normal) [Earth Gravitational Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Gravitational_Model) (EGM), a description of the associated [World Magnetic Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Magnetic_Model) (WMM), and a current list of local datum transformations.

The **EGM96 geoid defines** the nominal sea level surface by means of a spherical harmonics series of degree 360. The deviations of the EGM96 geoid from the WGS 84 reference ellipsoid range from about âˆ’105 m to about +85 m.

In geodesy, a **reference ellipsoid** is a mathematically defined surface that approximates the geoid, which is the truer, imperfect figure of the Earth, or other planetary body, as opposed to a perfect, smooth, and unaltered sphere, which factors in the undulations of the bodies' gravity due to variations in the composition and density of the interior, as well as the subsequent flattening caused by the centrifugal force from the rotation of these massive objects (for planetary bodies that do rotate).
